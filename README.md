# <span>Vache Taureau</span>
<hr/>
<h3>ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Karama-karama</h3>

<p>This game is developeted for a java course project. 

It's a number guessing game using "Vache" and "Taureau" as the key words (Yes they are the french words for Cow and Tauraus !)
<p>
<hr>
How it works 
<ul>
    <li>Input = a number of 4 digits with no repeating number ( 1234 or 4521 or 4789 and NOT 4456)</li>
    <li>Output x Vache and y Taureau </li>
     Vache = The number guessed exists but is not in the right place
    <br> Taureau = The number guessed exists and is in the right place
    <li> You have 10 tries to guess the number (When you get 4 Taureau)  </li>
</ul>
</p>
</p>
<hr> <h3> Demo </h3>
the number we are trying to guess is 1234 
<br> 
<ul> Try nÂ° 1 : 1145
    <li> Invalid input ! No repeating numbers !</li>
    <li> Give another guess </li>
</ul>
<ul> Try nÂ° 2 : 4569
    <li> 1 V & 0 T</li>
    <li> Give another guess </li>
     (PS :The outpu does not specify which number is V or T, We have to use our brains to figure it out)
</ul>
<ul> Try nÂ° 3 : 1246
    <li> 1 V 2 T</li>
    <li> Give another guess </li>
</ul>
<ul> Try nÂ° 4 : 1234
    <li> 0 V 4 T </li>
    <li> Good Job ! you fisured it out in 4 guesses only ! </li>
</ul>
